This is a **portable Windows application** that automates the process of standardizing personnel image files used by the **Welfare Organization**.

## ðŸš€ Project Purpose

The WO uses attendance control devices that store personnel images with the format: LF + 11-digit code + .png


Manually processing and renaming these images is time-consuming and error-prone. This application was developed to fully **automate** the following tasks:

- âœ… Remove the `LF` prefix
- âœ… Replace the 11-digit identification code with the **employee's card number**
- âœ… Convert image files from `.png` to `.jpg`

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. The user provides an **Excel file** containing:
   - 11-digit identification codes
   - Employee card numbers

2. The program reads all `.png` images from the selected folder.

3. For each image:
   - It finds the matching card number.
   - Renames the image using that card number.
   - Converts it to `.jpg`.

4. A report Excel file is generated listing:
   - Images with no matching card number
   - Card numbers with no corresponding image

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- âœ… Fully portable `.exe` (no installation required)
- âœ… Excel input support
- âœ… Duplicate checking (images already processed are skipped)
- âœ… Generates report for incomplete/missing data
- âœ… Saves time and reduces human error

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Dummy image files and Excel samples are included in the release for testing purposes.  
Feel free to test the program with these samples before using your real data.
